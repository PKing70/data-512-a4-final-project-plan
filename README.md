## How to get Chosen by Donors
DonorsChoose is a crowd-sourced nonprofit providing a platform for teachers to request funding from the public for classroom supplies and projects. My project will statistically analyze the DonorsChoose public datasets to try to identify factors that produce more effective project funding requests. I want to do this project to learn how teachers could discover from prior funding efforts, in order to improve the chances or rates of attracting classroom project donations and retain donor participation across multiple projects. I think DonorsChoose is an interesting approach to crowdfunding education expenses for a population (teachers) that often must use their personal funds to equip their classrooms or enable their students to participate in certain learning experiences. However, many teachers might not know how to analyze the public DonorsChoose data to find trends for successful funding campaigns, so any tips, tricks, insights or "secrets" might be valuable to document and share. First, I intend to share anything I learn with my wife who often must fund her ideas and classrooms from our savings, usually without reimbersement, so my intentions are in no way purely altuistic, but also quite self-serving.



Why are you planning to do this analysis? 

Provide background information about the topic, research questions/hypotheses, (imagined) business goals, and anything else that will be required to properly contextualize your study.

●What is your plan? Describe and link to the data sources will you collect, how data will be collected and processed, the analysis you intend to perform, and the outcomes and deliverables you anticipate. 

●Are there any unknowns or dependencies that might affect your ability to complete this project? 

●How do human-centered design considerations inform... a.your decision to pursue this projectb.your approach to performing the work?

What type of data and analysis?

●Must use publicly-available and appropriately licensed dataset(s)

●Can be a ‘classic’ statistical analysis, or the design and/or evaluation of a machine learning model

●Use your own definition of ‘big data’

●Choose datasets and analyses that are likely to support reproducibility

●Choose datasets and methods that let you answer questions that you find interesting and important

●Visualizations aren’t necessary, but encouraged as an effective way of communicating your findings

You can only use a dataset for your project if the license or terms of use allow you to collect the data, analyze it, and re-publish it publicly.

●Some licenses and terms of use specifically prohibit that. 

●Some TOU say it’s okay for non-commercial purposes (like academic research). 

●Some data sources don’t specify a license or terms of use for their data (hint: avoid these).

How to document your data

When your dataset has an explicit license

1.State the license of your data (e.g. “CC-By-SA 4.0”) in your report.

2.When possible, link to the license deed, e.g. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/

When data re-use is covered under the provider’s Terms of Use1.Quote the relevant section of the terms of use in your report2.Link to the terms of use pageIf possible, link to the original source of the data, which may be different from where you found it. 

●E.g. MovieLens data on the GroupLens website vs. MovieLens data on Kaggle

Be careful with Kaggle data

Many of those datasets are not explicitly licensed. If you cannot find appropriate license information for the data, you cannot use it. You’ll fail the assignment, even if the rest of your work is really good. :/Many of those datasets have already been analyzed by other Kagglers. Many of those analyses are public on Kaggle.com. 

●Your analysis should not simply duplicate analysis that Kagglers have already done on this dataset (e.g. “do more data scientists use Python or R?”).

●It’s perfectly fine to build off of the analysis that others have done, just make sure you cite the original analysis. 

●Tip: Avoid even looking like you might be plagiarizing someone else’s analysis. 

Talking about genderMany projects are centred on gender as a variable. Since the assignment requires you to think about ethics, consider what ‘gender’ is:

●Not the same as sex (‘man’, ‘woman’ not ‘male’, ‘female’)

●Not a binary (people have identities other than ‘man’ or ‘woman’)

●Not impermeable (people transition between genders)

●Something that creates myriad different experiences of life that are likely to be reflected in your data.

Talking about genderQuestions to ask:

●Does your data only contain binary options? If so, note that as a limitation - and note why it is a limitation (it excludes people outside that binary).

●Does your data include trans people? If so, incorporate that into the gender research. If not, highlight that as a limitation
